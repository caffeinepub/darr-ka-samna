  "summary": "Diff implements public-by-default stories, adds per-story view counts with a client-side single-increment guard, replaces comments UI with public name+message submission, and adds a site-wide Follow button + follower count. However, follow state is not persisted per principal and there is no unfollow/toggle behavior evidenced; backend-side authorization for unauthenticated comment posting is not clearly evidenced in the provided truncation.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Posting a comment does not require Internet Identity authentication; comments are publicly readable to all visitors.",
      "reason": "Frontend comments UI posts via actor.addComment(storyId, name, message), but the diff summary does not include the backend addComment/getComments implementations (truncated), so there is no concrete evidence that backend authorization was removed/adjusted to allow unauthenticated callers to post and all callers to read.",

      "requirement": "Follow state is persisted per signed-in Internet Identity principal and supports follow/unfollow (Follow/Following toggle) with UI updating after follow/unfollow, without collecting emails.",
      "reason": "Frontend FollowButton uses only local component state (hasFollowed) and disables the button after following; there is no evidence of reading persisted follow status on load, nor any unfollow mutation. Backend shows only a single followerCount : Nat without any per-principal follower registry/map, so per-principal persistence and unfollow/toggle behavior are not evidenced.",

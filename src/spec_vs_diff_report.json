  "summary": "The diff makes broad backend and frontend functionality changes (stories/comments APIs, UI updates for comments/search/story/nav), but it does not provide clear evidence of addressing a specific deployment/build failure root cause or making targeted build/deploy configuration fixes required by REQ-14.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Identify the root cause of the current deployment/build failure and apply code/config changes required so the project builds and deploys successfully when retried.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows significant feature/application code changes but does not show any explicit fix for a build/deployment failure (e.g., dependency/config/DFX/canister build adjustments) or evidence that the standard build/deploy retry issue was identified and resolved. No build/deploy configuration files are shown as modified, and nothing in the diff summary ties changes to a deployment failure root cause.",
